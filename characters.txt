Elara, a wisp of a girl with eyes the color of forest moss, possessed a spirit as untamed as the wind. Curiosity was her truest north, often leading her beyond the safety of Oakhaven's well-trod paths. So, when her nimble fingers unearthed a mysterious, ancient map, a thrill of brave wonder, rather than fear, ignited within her.

By Elara's side, a silent, grey wolf named Shadow moved with a graceful power that belied his gentle nature with her. His amber eyes, keen and watchful, missed nothing, often alerting Elara to unseen movements in the undergrowth. Fiercely loyal, he was her steadfast companion, a silent guardian whose presence alone offered immense comfort against the growing unease of the path ahead.
